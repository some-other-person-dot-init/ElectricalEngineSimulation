# Electrical Engine Simulation
This is my small project, where I want to implement the simplified mathematical model of Electrical Motor with DC/AC converter using wxWidgets GUI.

As for now (16.08.22) it is far from being complete, as it doesn't feature several things yet:
- Template classes
- Real mathematical model
- Math graph with ability to save a plot into an image file
- Several types of engines and control systems
- Proper reactive resistance simulation
- Use of file as an input stream

What it does contain is:
- Very simplified model of three-phase asynchronous motor
- Non-controlable converter
- Train wheel, which serves as a mechanical part of the model and does not (yet) have a friction whatsoever
- More or less working GUI
- Output in multilined textbox
